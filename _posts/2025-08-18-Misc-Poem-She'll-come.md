# She’ll come  

<br>

> **Come O mother of death, Come to me—  
> I’m stuck in this barren heath [^1],  
> Set me free—**  
>   
> **I have seen enough,  
> I have tasted the life,  
> No need to bring the cuff,  
> Just rush me to your hive.**  
>   
> **You might ask- On the fly,  
> You didn’t believe in me-  
> I’ll reply as I lay,  
> please forgive me.**  
>   
> **I’ll share my story, again n again,  
> I wont lie today, as I fear no chain [^2],  
> I know you’ll hear n heal my pain,  
> Take me as I am, and make me sain [^3].**  
>

I wrote this poem on a moody afternoon, after a deep philosophical discussion with myself about how amazing death is.  
Even with my janky English, I tried to portray my inner feelings as transparently as possible.
